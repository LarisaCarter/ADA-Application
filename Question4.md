##_Question 4_  
####Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?  
---  

I graduated from college in 2014 in the middle of the Recession. I felt pressed to find a career and a job after college in a very tight job market. I learned about the organization [Teach Kentucky](http://www.teachkentucky.com/) and their recruitment progam which seemed too good to be true. As long as I had a science degree I was all but guaranteed a full-time, salaried job as a classroom teacher and support to get on-track for a Master's degree.

>When did I realize this was a mistake, you ask? If I'm being real with myself, I realized teaching wasn't for me before I even applied to the program. But I was stubborn and determined and teaching seemed like the best route to _helping others_, my one and only career ambition as a senior at the University of Montana. 

I have never been one to ask others for advice. I generally make a decision and stick to it, come hell or high water. As I was applying for Teach Kentucky, I actively avoided any advice or questions about my next steps after college. I felt so much pressure to have a career straight out of college. I didn't want to hear people's criticisms of my plan to relocate to Kentucky. Nor did I want to hear that I wasn't cut out to be a teacher. 

Turns out, other people are pretty wise if you'll just hear them out. I wound up a credentialed Middle School Science Teacher when I am obviously much better suited to work in a completely different capacity. 

> From this experience, I learned to accept myself and my talents for what they are. I have learned not to try to fit into a role that does not allow me to be myself. 

That is not to say that there aren't some parts of teaching that I truly enjoy. I challenged myself to make the best of the situation and to continue to grow as a scientist, a thinker, and an educator. After this year, my school is being restructured and relocated and all teachers are being overstaffed and transferred. I'm glad I continued to challenge myself to continue to learn new things during this time because I feel that I have developed the interest, confidence, and skills necessary to be a competitive applicant for the Ada Developers Academy.

I am fortunate to have encountered another opportunity to be considered as a candidate for a prestigious career preparation program. I am bursting at the seams with excitement for the chance to participate in a collaborative, STEAM environment. I've told anyone who will listen about Ada's Program. Those who know me well and who know my talents and abilities are saying **GO FOR IT!!!** My fiancee and I have saved up enough money to make relocating to Seattle happen and he has found an entry-level job in education in the Seattle area. He is going to make a fabulous Math Teacher one day.

_I have learned to keep my personal development at the forefront of my mind. I have learned to be real with myself. I can't allow myself to get lazy and accept the easy option. My three years as a teacher have shaped me into a braver, bolder, more confident young woman. I'm no longer embarrassed to take up space or to have a voice and an opinion. I have given myself permission to pursue the programming career I am passionate about because I'm worth it._
