##_Question 4_  
####Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?  
---  

I graduated from college in 2014 in the middle of the Recession. I felt pressed to find a career and a job after college in a very tight job market. I learned about the organization [Teach Kentucky](http://www.teachkentucky.com/) and their recruitment progam which seemed too good to be true. As long as I had a science degree I was all but guaranteed a full-time, salaried job as a classroom teacher and support to get on-track for a Master's degree.

>When did I realize this was a mistake, you ask? If I'm being real with myself, I realized teaching wasn't for me before I even applied to the program. But I was stubborn and it seemed like the best option at the time.
