##_Question 3_  
#### After reading [Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement](http://adadevelopersacademy.org/program), how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?  
---  

##Vision  
> _"Ada Developers Academy is dedicated to increase the number of underrepresented skilled software developers while redefining and reinventing the way we prepare individuals to be successful in information technology careers. With an intensive, inclusive, and positive learning community, we aim to directly address both the information technology labor shortage in Washington and the lack of diverse experience, thought, and background in the software industry."_ 

I am excited to have the opportunity to be involved with an organization that values underrepresented talent. 

I am: 
* excited for the chance to apply to Ada  
* a female in the STEAM field 
* an educator  
* a cis-gender white female  
* a West Coast native  

I have: 
* worked with over 300 students from diverse backgrounds  
* an African American fiancee who taught me the meaning of _"grind"_  
* earned _a B.A. **and** an M.A.T_  
* learned Spanish from Mexican immigrants  
* studied the systems of the body on a cadaver
* washed dishes to pay for classes
* tutored Univesity student athletes
* donated plasma to pay for groceries

I think about: 
* patterns
* metacognition
* music
* language
* learning new things
* making the world a better place

##Mission
> _"Ada Developers Academyâ€™s mission is to diversify Tech by providing women and people of non-binary gender the skills, experience, and community support to become professional software developers who contribute to changing the world with software."_

I understand how to integrate skill and theory with hands-on experience. And I know how to seek out the resources I need in order to accomplish anything I set my mind to. I want to learn with others and help to _"change the world with software"_. 


##Program
> _"Our highly immersive, tuition-free program combines classroom training and a paid, learning internship to teach women both how to write code (practical tools and computer science fundamentals) and how to be a software developer (leadership, inclusivity, and career). Our core values are building and contributing to a supportive community; creating and advocating for inclusivity; and teaching and practicing lifelong learning, all within Tech."_

I have the ability, experiences, grit, and determination to succeed at the Ada Developers Academy. I thrive in situations where I have the opportunity to learn and apply new strategies and technologies to new challenges. From the moment I read about the Academy, I knew I had to apply. I know I have the passion, dedication, and grit to become a member of the Tech community in Seattle. 


##Inclusivity

> _"Ada Developers Academy is designed to be an inclusive, positive learning environment for all students, regardless of sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, education, age, race, or religion. All women (cis and trans*) and people with non-binary gender who feel a part of women's community are encouraged to apply."_ 

Inclusivity is one of the biggest responsibilities of a classroom teacher. Middle school students are particularly concerned about being accepted by their peers and by the relatives, guardians, and teachers in their lives (though it will be many years until they are able to admit it!). 

My classroom rule is simple _"Respect: You. Others. Things."_ My students know that they will be respected for who they are. This helps foster a classroom  environment of learning instead of an atmosphere of exclusivity and favoritism. 

I believe that every person has the right to ["live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character"](http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm). That's the way I treat others and the way I expect to be treated in return.
