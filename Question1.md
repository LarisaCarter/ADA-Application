## _Question 1_  
#### Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

--- 

I became interested in computer programming about six months ago. I had heard about women's coding programs like [SkillCrush](http://www.skillcrush.com) through the [Stuff Mom Never Told You Podcast](http://www.stuffmomnevertoldyou.com/) several years ago, but at the time, I was focused on completing my Bachelor's Degree from the [University of Montana](http://www.umt.edu/) and finding a secure job once I graduated.  
>_I ended up in Louisville, Kentucky as a frazzled full-time 8th Grade Science Teacher **and** full-time Master's student at the [University of Louisville](http://louisville.edu/). I graduated in 2016 with a M.A. in Teaching and a very stressful job that didn't match my personality at all._  

This past fall, I found [Free Code Camp](freecodecamp.com), created a [profile](freecodecamp.com/larisacarter), and fell in love with [HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap](http://codepen.io/Lari_Michelle/). When I log in to Free Code Camp after work, I feel like a kid in a candy store. The rush of learning and problem-solving is addicting! I was so excited about it that I started teaching it to some of my students during study hall and they were just as interested. I had a great time walking them through the basics of what I had learned.

### [Ada Developers Academy's Program][ADA Program] emphasizes the following:

**How to Code**  
  * _Practical Tools_
  * _Computer Science Fundamentals_ 
  
**How to be a Software Developer**  
  * _Leadership_
  * _Inclusivity_
  * _Career_ 


## My Experiences 
>Even before I exposed myself to programming, I was interested in **science**, **math**, **language**, and **teaching**. These interests have prepared me to be successful as a student in the [Ada Developers Academy Program][ADA Program].

### Science  
My experience as a student and a teacher of **science** have played a significant role in my decision to pursue the Ada Developers Academy Program. Because I am so familiar with the principles and fundamentals of science (structure & function, scientific mindset, etc.), I recognize the same patterns as I am learning computer programming. To me, making those connections is really exciting! 
My background in [Environmental Studies](http://hs.umt.edu/evst/) also involves questions like "How do we motivate people to do the right thing for the planet?" Ethical issues like this one are also addressed by [Ada's Mission Statement](http://adadevelopersacademy.org/program): 
>Ada Developers Academyâ€™s mission is to diversify Tech by providing women and people of non-binary gender the skills, experience, and community support to become professional software developers who _contribute to **changing the world with software**_. 

I have extensive experience teaching data analysis strategies and techniques to middle school students. I have created hundreds of data analysis questions and projects for middle school students using [Google Drive](). 

### Teaching 
>I love adopting a "scientific mindset" with students. Brainstorming with middle schoolers is fascinating! I love building relationships with my students. Learning what students are "into" and how they view the world are so interesting. 

#### There are three main aspects of teaching that are related to the Ada Program:  
##### **1. Instruction** 
 * Designing lessons that are accessible to students  
 * Teaching students how to solve problems systematically  
 * Fostering a positive, inclusive space for learning 
 
##### **2. Mentorship** 
 * Encouraging development of a "scientific mindset"  
 * Demonstrated mentorship of student projects  
 * Mentorship of new first-year teachers in the building 
 
##### **3. Technology** 
 * Designing and creating projects that _unite people_ and are:  
   * _beautiful_  
   * _functional_  
   * _helpful_  
 * Personalizing projects to fit individual and group needs 

#### Math  

As an undergraduate,I thought about pursuing a Math Minor. I completed up through Multivariable Calculus without an issue. I used the tutoring center religiously and I enjoyed talking to other students about problem-solving and homework. Yeah, I was that kid.

In order to earn a minor, I would have had to take several very _intimidating_ **math courses**. I felt intimidated by the all-male 
faculty and the nearly all-male band of computer and math majors. I didn't see anyone who looked like me. I didn't know who to reach 
out to for help, so I shifted my focus from attempting to earn a Math Minor to earning Minors in Human Biology and Global Public Health. 

#### Espa{n}ol  

I also dedicated a lot of time to becoming a proficient Spanish speaker, reader, and writer. I loved "geeking out" on the grammar 
and conjugations and agreements. I also loved the collaborative nature of learning a language. Basically, the only way to learn a language is through _collaborating_ and talking to _people from other cultures_. And I won't even get into the similarities between theory (_grammar_) and application (_speaking, reading, and writing_) to computer programming. 

## Final Thoughts

Needless to say, I don't regret any of the decisions I made with regard to my course of study in college. Knowing what I know about myself and how I think and learn, I wish I would have faced my fears down in the basement dungeon of the computer lab and given Computer Language a try back then. I'm excited and ready to tackle my fears with courage this time around. Based on experiences and opportunities I have had to develop a passion for computer science, I am confident that I want to pursue a career in programming. 

I'm thankful that I had Ada Developers Academy popping into my mail inbox, nudging me to face my fear and apply to the Ada Developers Academy. I'm so happy for the chance to learn new skills and apply them to a career in programming.
