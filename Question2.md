## _Question 2_  
#### If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years? 
---

### Leadership  

If I am accepted to the Ada Developers Academy Progam, in five years, I see myself managing a small team of intern or entry-level software engineers. I think it's important to give back and it would be great to be able to use my knowledge of teaching and learning to help others get into Tech. 

### Field
#### Classroom Software  

I enjoy integrating technology into student learning in the classroom.  
* _I would be interested in a career that involves creating educational content software._  

#### Software that promotes diversity in Tech in the classroom  

Exposing all students, especially underrepresented groups, to high-quality STEAM educational opportunities at a young age can help them to develop the _"grit and determination"_ necessary to enter the field of Tech.  
* _I would be interested in a career that involves making STEAM opportunities accessible to all._  

#### Secondary Computer Science Standards Development  

Regardless of political views, the reality is that there will be many more charter schools and magnet schools in the U.S. Education System. As schools continue to try to stay relevant in today's changing world, many are offering computer classes. However, there is not a clear understanding of what "computer class" is.  
* _I would be interested in a career that involves researching and developing open source Computer Science Standards that could be adopted by any interested teacher, school, or district._ 

### Location  
>Top 3 Reasons my Mom loves Ada Developers Academy  
>1. Seattle is less than a 15 hour drive from home.  
>2. It doesn't snow very often.  
>3. It's not humid.  

I grew up in Central Valley, California. At 18, I moved to Missoula, Montana for University. One month after graduation, I relocated to Louisville, Kentucky, and started my Master's degree. My parents always warned me that I would want to move back home. Seattle is a great compromise as far as I'm concerned. 

### Learning

If accepted to the Academy's Program, in five years I will still be seeking out solutions to new challengs in the field of Tech. I am especially committed to facing the challenge of inclusivity. Making others feel welcome and important is one of my key responsibilities as a classroom teacher and I would continue to foster inclusivity in all areas of the Tech industry.
